# Cloud-Pi Docs

The source of the documentation gets built in the folder `../site` and is published to official site. Our docs use extended markdown as implemented by MkDocs.

## Building the documentation

* install MkDocs pip install mkdocs
* mkdocs serve starts a local webserver at localhost:8000
* mkdocs build Builds a static site in ../site directory
* config docs with (../mkdocs.yml)
